# The Work of Christ - Part 1

## Statement
We believe (1) that the Lord Jesus Christ lived a sinless life, was perfectly obedient to His Father in every way, and ushered in the promised Kingdom of God in all His words and deeds; (2) that, for the joy set before Him, He offered up Himself as the perfect substitutionary and atoning sacrifice for sinners, (3) triumphing over sin, death, and all the forces of evil, and purchasing for Himself a people out of every tribe, language, and nation; (4) that on the cross the Son of God received in His person the due penalty of Godâ€™s wrath against our sin, and (5) that His shed blood is the sole basis for our salvation and the greatest revelation of the glory of the grace of our God.
