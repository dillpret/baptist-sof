# The Holy Spirit

## Statement
We believe (1) that the Holy Spirit is the Lord, the giver of life, who formed the world, empowered certain individuals for Godâ€™s purposes, and who speaks in the Holy Scriptures; (2) that God anointed Jesus Christ with the Spirit for His ministry and that the Spirit was given to the Church at Pentecost to indwell, lead, and unite believers, gifting each of them for various works of service; (3) that the Holy Spirit glorifies Christ, gives understanding of the Word, convicts people of their sin, unites believers to Jesus, and forms the character of Christ within them; and (4) that the Spirit pours the love of God into our hearts, enables prayer and witness, and seals the believer for the day of the redemption of their bodies.
