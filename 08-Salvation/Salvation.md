# Salvations

## Statement
We believe (1) that through the call of God in the Gospel message, all who receive Christ Jesus as Saviour and Lord are born again by the Holy Spirit, becoming a new creation in Christ; (2) that through faith in Him, sinners have the forgiveness of sins and are declared righteous on the grounds of His shed blood; (3) that repentance is a condition of this salvation and the first sign of that holiness without which no one will see the Lord; (4) that by virtue of their union with Christ, believers share in all the benefits of grace that are in Him, including the adoption as sons and the gift of the Holy Spirit; and (5) that all who turn from their sin, trusting Christ, may have the assurance that they will be kept and accepted by Him.

## Memory Verse
Titus 3:4-7 ESV - "But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life."
