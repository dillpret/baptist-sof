# The Mission of God

## Statement
We believe (1) that the mission of the Church is to make disciples of all people groups in all places through the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and to plant and establish local churches to obey all that Jesus taught the Apostles; (2) that in loving our neighbour as ourselves, compassionately, practically and wisely, we image the love of God to all; and (3) that we should do all this according to the Scriptures, under the shadow of the Cross and in the power of the resurrection.
