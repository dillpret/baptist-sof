# Scripture

## Statement
We believe (1) that the Holy Scriptures
consist of the 66 books of the Old and
New Testaments, and (2) that the Spirit of
God so influenced the authors that these
writings are the Word of God; (3) that
because of the divine origin and
inspiration of its words, the Scriptures are
true in all that they affirm and are
trustworthy and without error; (4) that
these Scriptures are the complete and only
written revelation of God to people, and in
them are clearly revealed those truths
necessary for our salvation, godly living,
and maturity in Christ; and (5) that
Scripture alone is our sufficient and final
authority in all matters of belief and
practice
