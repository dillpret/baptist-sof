# The Ordinances

## Statement
We believe (1) that the Lord Jesus Christ appointed two ordinances – Baptism and the Lord’s Supper – to be observed as acts of obedience and as witnesses to the primary facts of the Christian faith; (2) that Baptism is the immersion of a professing believer in water as a confession of identification with Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection; and (3) that the Lord’s Supper is the partaking of the bread and the cup, signifying our participation in the Saviour’s body and shed blood in remembrance of His death until He comes.
