# The Resurrection

## Statement
We believe (1) in the bodily resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous; (2) that all people will appear before God’s judgement seat to receive their due for the things done while in the body; (3) that those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life will enter into eternal life, but the unrighteous into eternal condemnation; and (4) that according to God’s promise we look forward to a new heaven and a new earth in which righteousness dwells, when we will forever be with the Lord, and He with us: Come Lord Jesus, come!  Amen.

## Memory Verse
Revelation 21:3-4 ESV - "And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.""
